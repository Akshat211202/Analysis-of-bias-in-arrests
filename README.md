Analyzing Arrest Patterns and Racial Representation in Toronto

## Overview
The city of Toronto has an extremely diverse population in terms of its ethnicity and culture. This paper examines arrest data from the Toronto police service between 2020 and 2021. It focuses on the distribution of arrests by ethnic identity, age, and booking status. This is done to check whether policing practices exhibit systemic bias. By cleaning and analyzing the records, trends are explored over major ethnic groups. Despite concerns over racial bias, the data suggests that arrests are influenced by objective factors, though there still may be disparities due to socio-economic status. These findings may help in providing insights that may enhance transparency in policing practices.
